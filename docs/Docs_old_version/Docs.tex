This documents contains the api descriptions of wavepy and some general remarks. 

wavepy is a python wrapper for WAVE that allows easy calculation of spectra with wave from magnetic field data. Also functionality for the loading and interpolation of magnetic field data is incorporated.

\chapter{Description of Usage}

\section{Wave Axis Nomenclature}

Flight direction of the electron is $x$. The vertical direction (in planer undulators) is called $y$ and the horizontal is $z$.

\section{Spectrum Calculations}

Import the wavepy project and create a wave instance by writing:
\begin{verbatim}
import wavepy as wpy
wave = wpy.create_wave_instance('wave_from_by')
\end{verbatim}
WAVE can perform many different tasks, one of which is calculating a spectrum from a given B-field. This specific functionality is so far covered in wavepy. You can calculate the spectra from a magnetic field in $B_y$ direction only by using \verb+wave_from_by+, from $B_y$ and $B_z$ data by setting \verb+wave_from_byz+ and from all components by writing \verb+wave_from_bxyz+. All field data should be in the format of two cols, the first one containing x in mm and the second B in T, no separators and header lines.

Next you can get standard wave parameters by writing:
\begin{verbatim}
paras = wave.get_paras()
\end{verbatim}
\clearpage
\begin{landscape}
The parameter object is a simple python dictionary with the following keys which correspond to wave settings:
\begin{verbatim}
			b_type - which type of b-calculation? 'By' - only By given, 'Byz'
				and 'Bxyz'. Each b-field in different file
			wave_prog_folder - main folder where wave is stored (ending on /)
			in_file_folder - folder in which the wave in-files are stored (ending on /)
			in_files - the wave in-files to be used for different b_type situations, is 
			dic: { b_type : wave_in_file }	
			field_folder - folder where b-field files are stored
			field_files - the b-field files list, file format: 2cols:
				 x[mm] and B[T], no separator and no headers
			res_folder - the folder in which the results are to be stored (ending on /)
			wave_data_res_folder - Subfolder of res_folder where wave data is stored
			pics_folder - subfolder of res_folder were pics are stored
			res_summary_file - name of the summary_file to be written
			no_copy - list of file names not to be copied/moved after simulation from wave stage folder
			wave_ending_extract - file endings to move from wave stage folder after simu
			wave_ending_copy - file endings of files to be copied (not moved)
			wave_res_copy_behaviour:
				'copy_all', 'copy_del_none' - only writes res_summary, 'copy_essentials' 
				only copies whats needed for: flux, flux_dens, flux_dens_distri, power, files 
				set in wave_files_essentials
			wave_files_essentials - essential files, if wave_res_copy_behaviour set to 'wave_res_copy_behaviour' 
				only those files are stored
			zip_res_folder - truth value, zip or not zip results
			freq_low - lower frequency (actualy energy) of spectrum to calc [eV]
			freq_high - upper frequency (actualy energy) of spectrum to calc [eV]
			freq_num - number of frequencies to calc
			beam_en - beam energy in [GeV]
			current - current [A]
			pinh_w - pinhole width (horizontal-z) [mm]
			pinh_h - pinhole height (vertical-y) [mm]
			spec_calc - truth value: calc spectrum or not, if not, only trajectory is written to file
			pinh_x - position of pinhole along optical axis [m]
			pinh_nz - number of points in pinhole horizontally
			pinh_ny - number of points in pinhole vertically
\end{verbatim}
\end{landscape}
Set parameters and run wave by:
\begin{verbatim}
wave.set_paras(paras)
wave.run_wave()
\end{verbatim}
Extract and plot results by writing:
\begin{verbatim}
data = wave.extract_wave_results(results = ['flux_dens_distr','traj_magn',
	'power_distr','flux','flux_dens',\
 	'brill' ], plot = True, en_range = [300,500])
\end{verbatim}
The result strings shown here are all that are permissible until now.

\subsection{Summary File}

wavepy then saves all the data that is set to be saved into the designated folder and zips all data for storage. On plotting the data is unzipped and zipped again. Furthermore, a file \verb+res_summary.txt+ is written and stored inside the zip archive. This file contains some general information extracted from wave about the current simulation run, including:
\begin{verbatim}
bmax [T] : max. b field
bmin [T] : min. b field
first_int [Tm] : first ingegral
scnd_int [Tmm] : second integral
power [kW] : total emitted power
pinhole_x [m] : dist. of pinhole from undulator centre
Fund. Freq. [eV] : fundamental frequency
Undu_Para : undulator parameter K
gamma : well, you guessed it
half_opening_angle [rad] : the half-opening angle
cone_radius_at_x [mm] : the cone-radius at the position
	of the pinhole (tan(half_opening_angle)*pinhole_x)
\end{verbatim}

\section{B-Field Interpolation}

Keep in mind that WAVE expects the magnetic field data over mm.

You can load files containing magnetic field data for different gaps by writing:
\begin{verbatim}
b_field_data = wpy.load_b_fields_gap(folder)
\end{verbatim}

The file name format should be: somename + gap\_x\_ + restname + .ending. E.g.; \verb+myfile_g_23_.dat+. With the gap given in mm. 
To plot the b-field data do:
\begin{verbatim}
wpy.plot_b_field_data( b_fields = b_field_data )
\end{verbatim}
You can center the data and cut all loaded magnetic fields to the defined on the same interval by writing:
\begin{verbatim}
wpy.center_b_field_data( b_fields = b_field_data, lim_peak = 0.01 )
wpy.cut_data_support(b_fields = b_field_data, col_cut = 'x')
\end{verbatim}
The centering is done by identifying the first and last peaks and centering those. The option lim\_peak gives the minimal height a peak has to have to be identified as a peak - this is necessary to account for noise in the data.
Save the processed fields by writing:
\begin{verbatim}
wpy.save_prepared_b_data(b_fields = b_field_data, folder = folder)
\end{verbatim}
Next we can interpolate the data by writing:
\begin{verbatim}
interp_field = wpy.interpolate_b_data(b_fields = b_field_data, 
	gap = gap, lim_peak = 0.01)
\end{verbatim}
Where gap is the gap at which you'd like to interpolate.

\chapter{Troubleshooting}

\begin{itemize}
\item WAVE cannot be executed: Is the file \verb+wavepy/WAVE/bin/wave.exe+ executable?
\item If files cannot be copied after simulation: Is the result folder you specified existing?
\item interpolated files cannot be saved: Is the folder where the files are supposed to go existing?
\item WAVE is complaining about: ``NEGATIVE OR ZERO PHOTON ENERGY OCCURED WHILE EXTENDING ENERGY '' : Increase the number of energy points - parameter \verb+freq_num+. Wave is extending the energy range you speficied in order to calculate the folding procedure and may, with too little points on which to calculate, run into negative energies. This is especially important at low energy values.
\item Wave complains it cannot find a zip file while trying to plot: Were the results files not properly stored before? Check if the data folder contains more than a zip file and delete everything but the zip.
